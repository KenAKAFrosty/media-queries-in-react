# Media Queries in React

You might find you want to use the power of media queries but within your React component. 

If so, we'll get you up and running in just a minute or few!
<br>
<br>

## Importing and setting up

### First, in your terminal while in the root directory of your project:
```
npm i media-queries-in-react
```

### Then, in the file with the React component you want to use, just one import:
``` js
import useMediaQueries from "media-queries-in-react" 
```
or (depending on which syntax you're using)
```js
const useMediaQueries = require("media-queries-in-react")
```
<br>


### Then, in the body of your function component, define the queries you'd like to use like this:
 
```js
export default function Component(){ 

    const mediaQueries = useMediaQueries({
        narrow: "screen and (max-width: 400px)",
    });


    return() { ...
```

The argument you pass into `useMediaQueries()` is a simple javascript object where the keys are the friendly names you'd like to have for your queries, and the values are the media query strings ([Here's a link to the MDN docs for all the available queries, and the syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries)).

Just to be clear, the above example could just as easily use `under400` as the key for its query, and could have included other queries as well:
```js
export default function Component(){ 

    const mediaQueries = useMediaQueries({
        under400: "screen and (max-width: 400px)",
        landscape: "(orientation: landscape)"
    });


    return() { ...
```
The keys you choose are completely up to you. 
<br>
<br>


## Accessing the queries

When you define your queries and their friendly names within `useMediaQueries()`, it returns to you an object with the same keys (your friendly names). 

The value of any given key is a boolean, representing if that media query is matched. 

### Using the first example from above:
 
```js
export default function Component(){ 

    const mediaQueries = useMediaQueries({
        narrow: "screen and (max-width: 400px)",
    });

    console.log(mediaQueries.narrow) 
    //will print true if screen width is 400px or less, otherwise false.

    return() { ...
```
That's it! You now have full access to media queries in your JSX and can use them however you see fit. 

They will automatically update if the user changes screen sizes, flips from portrait to landscape, etc.
<br>
<br>

# Using the queries
Let's continue that example from above. Let's say you want some simple inline styles:
```js
export default function Component(){ 

    const mediaQueries = useMediaQueries({
        narrow: "screen and (max-width: 400px)",
    });

    return() { 
        <p style={ {fontSize:22} }>Hello, world!</p>
    }
```
But you notice the font feels a little too big on smaller screens. No problem!
```js
export default function Component(){ 

    const mediaQueries = useMediaQueries({
        narrow: "screen and (max-width: 400px)",
    });

    const fontSize = mediaQueries.narrow ? 16 : 22

    return() { 
        <p style={ {fontSize} }>Hello, world!</p>
    }
```
<br>
<br>
Or maybe you're happy to leave the styling up to the CSS, but you want to easily change the rendered text depending on a media query. 

```js
export default function Component(){ 

    const mediaQueries = useMediaQueries({
        narrow: "screen and (max-width: 400px)",
        isDesktop: "(hover) and (pointer: fine)"
    });

    return() { 
        <p>Hello, {mediaQueries.isDesktop ? "desktop" : "mobile"} user!</p>
    }
```
<br>

### So far these are pretty simple examples, but where this can come in very handy is when you need to combine a media query with some other conditon or piece of data, like a prop.

##### (That other data usually won't be available to your CSS, so it becomes a song and dance to get the two to cooperate, and breaks easily.)
<br>
<br>

Let's say your component has a prop called `user`. Maybe you only want to render a special component if the user is a long-term member -- but on smaller screens that makes your page way too busy, or moves something important below the fold.

So now you want to make sure they're a long-term member AND the screen is a certain size. 

```js
export default function Component({user}){ 

    const mediaQueries = useMediaQueries({
        narrow: "screen and (max-width: 400px)",
        isDesktop: "(hover) and (pointer: fine)"
    });

    return() { 
        <p>
            Hello, {mediaQueries.isDesktop ? "desktop" : "mobile"} user!
        </p>

        {!mediaQueries.narrow && user.isLongTermMember &&
           <SpecialOfferForLongTermMembers />
        }
    }
```


There are plenty more examples, but they all boil down to using the boolean value to accomplish your React-y magic ðŸ˜Š If there are other examples you think would be super helpful to cover, please don't hesitate to open a Pull Request with the example, or an Issue to discuss!

## The quick recap:
1) Import the function 
``` js
import useMediaQueries from "media-queries-in-react"
//or
const useMediaQueries = require("media-queries-in-react")
```

2) Define your queries and give them friendly names for easy reference (inside the body of a React function component):
```js
const mediaQueries = useMediaQueries({ 
    ultraThin: "(max-width: 290px)",
    thin: "(max-width: 350px)",
    mobile: "(max-width: 480px)",
})
```

3) Access your media queries by getting the property according to your friendly name, which will be a boolean value representing if the media query is matched -- then use them however you need to in your React logic
```js
    const flexDirection = mediaQueries.thin ? 'column' : 'row';
```
```js
    const buttonLink = mediaQueries.mobile? "somewhere.com" : "somewhereelse.com"
```
```js
    if ( !mediaQueries.mobile ) { 
        return <InteractiveWidget />
     } else { 
        return <SimpleImageWithLink />
     }
```

# Tips & Tricks

- Since your input is a plain javascript object, it makes it a breeze to set up common breakpoints as a preset value. Imagine a separate file where you can store your default queries to easily import and reuse across all of your components. e.g.,
```js
    const defaultMediaQueries = { 
        tooNarrow: "screen and (min-width: 280px)",
        isMobile: "screen and (max-width: 480px)",
        isTablet: "(min-width: 750px) and (max-width: 1000px)",
        isDesktop: "(min-width: 1001px)"
    }

    export defaultMediaQueries;
```
